    "purpose1": "The 'Animeaux' mobile application is a back office that aims to simplify and optimize the management of rescued animals and their availability for accommodation for a foster family while the animal is being adopted. The application is therefore specially developed for the volunteers of the association, allowing them to easily access information on animals and foster families from their mobile phone, whether on Android or iOS. Thanks to this application, volunteers will be able to add an animal during an intervention, monitor information on each animal in real time, such as their state of health, their behavior, their diet, etc. They will also be able to update the information relating to each animal, such as their status to be housed and much more. Volunteers will be able to track requests to become foster families in real time, including their availability and location, as well as current foster family information, including pets housed and information about them. This will allow volunteers to efficiently manage the flow of applications to be foster families, to communicate with them quickly and to respond to the needs of the animals in a suitable way. The statistics will also be displayed in the application allowing volunteers to know the types of animals saved, the reasons for their abandonment, or the percentage of host families who have a garden, who have a car, etc. This can help the association to target the problems and set up awareness or prevention campaigns to avoid future situations of abandonment. Finally, statistics on foster families can help volunteers adapt their communication with potential candidates and find suitable accommodation solutions for each animal.",

This had led to long queues and fuel shortages in some service stations. We have therefore chosen to create an application that displays nearby gas stations according to their availability and the location of the user."
